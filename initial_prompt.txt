I want you to create a modern, professional three D CAD file visualization application. Here's my vision:

APPLICATION OVERVIEW:
Build a complete web app that helps users open a 3D CAD file of stl or stp format. The app should feel modern, intuitive, and professional. 

CORE FEATURES:
- App should allow usrs to select *.stl or *.stp files to open and display the 3D geometry form the files in a viewport. 
- It should show a tree like structure on the left of the UI and the view port that shows the names of the file opened. 
- User should be able to to open multiple files wither at once or one by one. 
- User should be able to interact with the 3D model using the mouse. 
- User should be element to select a triangle (if its a stl file) or a surface (if its a stp file) by clicking on the geoemtry by the mouse. 
- User should be able to pan, rotate, and zoom the camera view using the mouse. 

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Use VTK/Trame 
- Use python
- Use only python

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:
- Clean, modern interface with a professional color scheme
- Intuitive navigation and user experience
- Visual feedback for user actions
- Loading states and error handling
- Mobile-responsive design

SPECIFIC FUNCTIONALITY:
- Open files from the local disk
- Close files that are already open and delete those geometry from the view
- Color the selected trangles/surface when selected by left mouse bottom click
- Unselect with right mouse botton click

Please create this as a complete, production-ready application. Set up the project structure, implement all features, and make sure everything works together seamlessly. Focus on creating something that looks professional.

When you're done, provide instructions on how to run the application and test all features.
